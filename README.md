# Dive-into-Cryptography
This is a concise learning manual on cryptography that I personally wrote, covering fundamental concepts, mathematical foundations, code implementation, and more in cryptography. Please note that this book does not delve into currently trending areas in cryptography, such as privacy computing technologies.

# Preface

Hi there,

I am Elwood, and I earned a Master's degree in Cybersecurity in June 2023. I have a deep passion for the field of cybersecurity. Over the past few years, I've ventured into and delved into nearly every subdomain, encompassing software security, network security, blockchain security, digital forensics, and more.

As it is widely acknowledged, cryptography forms the foundational discipline of cybersecurity. Anyone engaged in this field should possess a solid understanding of cryptography. Unfortunately, existing books on cryptography lack associated code that could provide executable implementations after elucidating concepts. In the words of Linus, "talk is cheap, show me the code."

Code serves as the intermediary bridge between humans and computers, effectively abstracting, representing, and comprehending the concepts we study. This holds true even when delving into the realm of cryptography.

For these reasons, I've penned this book. Each chapter will intertwine with corresponding code implementations, aiding beginners in grasping and experiencing the allure of cryptography.

This book is released in an open-source format, allowing everyone to utilize it freely.

Should you have any matters for discussion or exchange, feel free to reach out to me via email at any time.



Elwood,

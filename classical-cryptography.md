# Classical Cryptography â… 

## Basic

What is cryptography? Cryptography is the study of how to secure information in communication or computer systems. It encompasses the theory and practice of developing and using cryptographic techniques to ensure that only authorized individuals can access information, while unauthorized individuals are unable to comprehend or alter the information. Cryptography typically includes the following aspects:

1. Encryption Algorithms: Encryption algorithms are a core component of cryptography, used to transform readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext to protect the confidentiality of information. Common encryption algorithms include symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms.
2. Key Management: Keys are special codes used during the encryption and decryption processes. Cryptography focuses on how to generate, distribute, use, and manage keys to ensure security and reliability.
3. Digital Signatures: Digital signatures are a technique used to verify the integrity and authenticity of files. They use asymmetric encryption to generate a unique digital digest for a file, ensuring that the file has not been tampered with during transmission.
4. Security Protocols: Security protocols are a set of rules and steps designed to ensure the security of communication and information exchange. For example, the SSL/TLS protocol is used for secure website communication.
5. Authentication: Cryptography is employed to develop authentication methods, ensuring that only authorized users can access systems or data.

Cryptography plays a crucial role in the field of information security, with applications spanning network communication, e-commerce, database management, email, and various other areas. Its goal is to provide security services such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, ensuring that data and communication are not subject to unauthorized access or modification during transmission and storage.

When studying cryptography, it is essential to grasp fundamental concepts, including plaintext, ciphertext, encryption, and decryption.

\
Plaintext : Plaintext refers to the original data or text in its raw form, without any encryption or transformation. It is the raw representation of information without any form of protection or concealment.

Ciphertext: Ciphertext refers to data or text that has undergone processing by an encryption algorithm. It is transformed from plaintext into a form that is not easily understood or recognized by using an encryption key, providing confidentiality and security.

Encryption: Encryption is the process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext. It involves using specific encryption algorithms and keys to convert information, ensuring that only those with the correct key can decrypt and restore the original information.

Decryption: Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, converting ciphertext back into plaintext. Only individuals with the correct decryption key can effectively perform the decryption operation.

In encryption systems, the selection of encryption algorithms and keys is crucial. Robust encryption algorithms and secure key management are key factors in ensuring information security. Encryption plays a vital role in protecting communication, data storage, and information transmission, especially in the fields of network security and privacy protection.

In cryptography, there are two main branches: Cryptanalysis and Cryptography.

1. Cryptography: This is the design aspect of cryptography, focusing on developing secure encryption algorithms and systems to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information during transmission and storage. Cryptography covers aspects such as the design of encryption algorithms, key management, digital signatures, security protocols, etc. Its goal is to provide a way to protect data from unauthorized access or tampering.
2. Cryptanalysis: This is the attack aspect of cryptography, aiming to study and develop techniques to break cryptographic systems, crack encryption algorithms, or obtain encrypted data. The goal of cryptanalysis is to understand the weaknesses of cryptographic systems in order to propose effective attack methods. Key recovery, plaintext attacks, and chosen plaintext attacks are all within the scope of cryptanalysis.

There is a competitive relationship between these two branches: cryptography strives to design more powerful encryption systems, while cryptanalysis attempts to find and exploit weaknesses in these systems. This competition drives continuous development in the field of cryptography to adapt to increasingly complex information security challenges. In practice, a successful cryptographic system needs to undergo extensive cryptanalysis testing to verify its security.

Cryptography is a branch of cryptology that focuses on the design and development of encryption algorithms and systems to safeguard information security. The goal of cryptography is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability during the processes of information transmission and storage.

1. Encryption Algorithms: Encryption algorithms are the core of cryptography. They are responsible for converting plaintext into ciphertext, ensuring that only authorized users can comprehend and restore the original information. There are two main types of encryption algorithms:
   * Symmetric Encryption Algorithm: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES).
   * Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm: Uses a pair of keys, namely a public key and a private key, for encryption and decryption. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a common asymmetric encryption algorithm.
2. Key Management: Keys are a critical component used during the encryption and decryption processes. Cryptography focuses on how to generate, distribute, use, and manage keys to ensure their security. Key management also includes aspects such as key updates, revocation, and storage.
3. Digital Signatures: Digital signatures are a technology used to verify the integrity of files and confirm their source. Cryptography utilizes asymmetric encryption algorithms to generate digital signatures, ensuring the authenticity and non-tampering of information. Digital signatures play a crucial role in authentication and data integrity verification.
4. Security Protocols: Security protocols are rules and procedures designed to protect information security during communication. The SSL/TLS protocol is a common security protocol used for encrypting network communication, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data.
5. Authentication: Cryptography involves designing methods to ensure that only authorized users can access systems or data. This includes techniques such as password authentication, two-factor authentication, and biometrics.
6. Randomness: Randomness in cryptography refers to the introduction of random elements during the encryption process to enhance the security of cryptographic systems. This may include initialization vectors (IV) and other random elements.

Cryptography is a crucial component of information security, aiming to provide a reliable way to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and tampering. In practice, cryptography needs to evolve continuously to adapt to evolving threats and attack techniques.

Cryptanalysis is a branch of cryptography that focuses on studying and developing techniques to break cryptographic systems, crack encryption algorithms, or obtain encrypted data. Its goal is to understand the weaknesses of cryptographic systems in order to propose effective attack methods. Cryptanalysis involves various attack techniques and methods:

1. **Key Recovery:** Cryptanalysis attempts to recover the key used by analyzing the relationship between ciphertext, plaintext, or the key itself. This may include known-plaintext attacks, chosen-plaintext attacks, or other methods to obtain key information.
2. **Known-Plaintext Attack:** In a known-plaintext attack, the attacker has access to some plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext. By analyzing these pairs, the attacker tries to deduce information about the encryption algorithm or key. Some simplified versions of symmetric encryption algorithms may be susceptible to known-plaintext attacks.
3. **Chosen-Plaintext Attack:** Unlike known-plaintext attacks, in a chosen-plaintext attack, the attacker can choose some plaintext and obtain the corresponding ciphertext. This attack model is more challenging as the attacker can selectively choose plaintext to gain a better understanding of the internal mechanisms of the cryptographic system.
4. **Ciphertext-Only Attack:** In a ciphertext-only attack, the attacker only has access to the encrypted ciphertext and cannot obtain corresponding plaintext or other information. This is a more challenging attack model as the attacker needs to deduce the key or plaintext through ciphertext analysis.
5. **Differential Cryptanalysis:** Differential cryptanalysis is an attack technique that attempts to deduce part or the entire key of a cryptographic algorithm by observing differences between input and output. This method is often used against symmetric encryption algorithms.
6. **Side-Channel Attacks :** Side-channel attacks exploit information related to the implementation of a cryptographic system, such as power consumption, execution time, or electromagnetic radiation, to gather information about the key or plaintext.

The development of cryptanalysis is an important aspect of cryptographic progress. Successful cryptanalysis often leads to improvements in cryptographic systems to resist new attack techniques. Therefore, designers and researchers in cryptography must continually consider and address the challenges posed by cryptanalysis to enhance the security of cryptographic systems.



| **Attack Type**            | **Description**                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Known-Plaintext Attack     | Attacker has access to some plaintext and corresponding ciphertext.          |
| Chosen-Plaintext Attack    | Attacker can choose plaintext and obtain corresponding ciphertext.           |
| Ciphertext-Only Attack     | Attacker only has access to encrypted ciphertext.                            |
| Differential Cryptanalysis | Attack technique observing differences between input and output.             |
| Side-Channel Attacks       | Exploit information related to the implementation of a cryptographic system. |

The table below lists types of attacks on encrypted information:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Ciphertext-Only Attack: In a ciphertext-only attack, the attacker only has access to encrypted ciphertext and cannot obtain corresponding plaintext or other information. This is a more challenging attack model as the attacker needs to deduce information about the key or plaintext through the analysis of ciphertext.
* Known-Plaintext Attack: In this type of attack, the attacker can acquire some known plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext. By analyzing these known plaintext-ciphertext pairs, the attacker attempts to deduce information about the encryption algorithm or key, making it easier to decrypt other messages.
* Chosen-Plaintext Attack: In this attack, the attacker can choose some plaintext and obtain the corresponding ciphertext. The attacker has the ability to selectively choose plaintext with a purpose, gaining a better understanding of the workings of the cryptographic system.
* Chosen-Ciphertext Attack: This is a more advanced attack where the attacker can choose some ciphertext and obtain the corresponding plaintext. This attack often involves a deep understanding of the encryption or decryption process, allowing the attacker to selectively obtain the results of decryption.
* Chosen-Text Attack : In a chosen-text attack, the attacker can choose some ciphertext and obtain the corresponding decrypted result. The attacker selectively submits specific ciphertext and then observes or obtains the decrypted plaintext. This attack model often considers the possibility that the attacker may have access to decryption services or devices.

## Substitution and **Transposition**

After understanding some essential basics of cryptography, we now turn to the study of classical ciphers.

The two most commonly used techniques in classical ciphers are substitution and permutation, used to change the positions or values of letters or bits in the plaintext to increase encryption complexity.

**Substitution :** Substitution refers to the process of replacing elements in the plaintext (usually letters) with another set of elements. This substitution can be one-to-one, many-to-one, or one-to-many. Substitution ciphers are among the earliest ciphers, where each letter or group of letters is mapped to another letter or group of letters. The Caesar cipher is a simple example, where letters are replaced according to a fixed offset.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (14) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Transposition:** Transposition refers to the rearrangement of elements in the plaintext rather than replacing them. In transposition ciphers, the ciphertext is typically created by rearranging or swapping the letters in the plaintext. The rail fence cipher is a simple transposition cipher where letters are arranged on a rail or fence according to a specific rule, and then read off either row-wise or column-wise to generate the ciphertex.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (15) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These two techniques are often combined to form more complex cryptographic systems. For instance, some modern cryptographic algorithms use the structure of a Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN), where substitution and permutation operations alternate to enhance the security of the cryptographic system. This combination leverages the confusion from substitution and the diffusion from permutation, making it more challenging for attackers to comprehend and reverse-engineer the cryptographic algorithm.

## Caesar cipher

Let's begin by learning about the Caesar Cipher.

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher, also known as a shift cipher. It is one of the earliest ciphers in classical cryptography and is named after the ancient Roman military leader Julius Caesar. It is said that Caesar used this encryption technique in military communications. The basic idea of the Caesar Cipher is to encrypt text by replacing letters with a fixed offset.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (16) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The specific steps are as follows:

1. **Choose Offset:** Select an integer as the offset, often referred to as the key of the Caesar Cipher. This offset determines the letter substitution rule.
2. **Encrypting the Plaintext:** For the text to be encrypted, replace each letter with the offset. For the English alphabet, a positive offset means a right shift, and a negative offset means a left shift. When a letter goes beyond the boundaries, it can wrap around. For example, if the chosen offset is 3, the letter "A" in the plaintext would be replaced with the letter "D" in the ciphertext, "B" would be replaced with "E," and so on.
3. **Decrypting the Ciphertext:** The decryption process is the reverse of encryption. Use the same offset to replace the letters in the ciphertext back to plaintext.

The encryption process of the Caesar Cipher can be represented using mathematical symbols: \[E(x) = (x + k) \mod 26] Where:

* (E(x)) represents the result of encrypting the letter (x).
* (k) is the offset.
* (\mod 26) ensures wrapping within the alphabet.

The security of the Caesar Cipher is very low as it has only 26 possible keys, and it can be easily cracked through a simple exhaustive search. In modern cryptography, the Caesar Cipher is used solely for educational purposes and not for securing sensitive information.

Exhaustive Search Attack, also known as a Brute Force Attack, is a fundamental cryptographic attack method. For the Caesar Cipher, conducting an exhaustive search is straightforward due to its limited key space.

Here are the general steps for an exhaustive search attack on the Caesar Cipher:

1. **Identify the Ciphertext:** The attacker obtains the encrypted ciphertext, the message encrypted using the Caesar Cipher.
2. **Exhaustive Offset Trial:** The attacker tries all possible offsets, ranging from 1 to 25 (as an offset of 0 is equivalent to no encryption, and an offset of 26 is the same as returning to the original text).
3. **Decrypt and Check Results:** For each offset, the attacker decrypts the ciphertext and checks if the resulting decryption is meaningful. This often involves using a dictionary or language model to determine which decrypted result makes sense.
4. **Determine the Correct Offset:** The attacker identifies the offset that produces a meaningful plaintext, successfully breaking the Caesar Cipher.

The time complexity of an exhaustive search attack is O(25) since there are 25 possible offsets. While this is a very inefficient attack method, it is often feasible due to the weaknesses of the Caesar Cipher.

One method to counteract exhaustive search attacks is to use more complex cryptographic algorithms with larger key spaces, making it impractical to attempt all possible keys. In modern cryptography, strong symmetric encryption algorithms and hash functions typically have sufficiently large key spaces, rendering exhaustive search attacks very difficult.

Here is a Caesar cipher implemented in Python.

```
def caesar_encrypt(text, shift):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            # Determine whether the character is uppercase or lowercase
            is_upper = char.isupper()
            # Convert the character to its corresponding ASCII value
            ascii_val = ord(char)
            # Perform the shifting operation
            shifted_ascii = (ascii_val - ord('A' if is_upper else 'a') + shift) % 26
            # Convert the ASCII value back to a character
            result += chr(shifted_ascii + ord('A' if is_upper else 'a'))
        else:
            # If the character is not a letter, add it directly to the result
            result += char
    return result

def caesar_decrypt(text, shift):
    # Decryption is essentially the inverse of encryption, so calling the encrypt function
    return caesar_encrypt(text, -shift)

# Example usage
plaintext = "Hello, World!"
shift_value = 3

# Encrypt
encrypted_text = caesar_encrypt(plaintext, shift_value)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_text}")

# Decrypt
decrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(encrypted_text, shift_value)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_text}")

```

This code implements encryption and decryption operations for the Caesar cipher.

1. `caesar_encrypt` function:
   * Parameters: `text` is the text to be encrypted, and `shift` is the offset used during encryption.
   * Returns: Returns the encrypted text.
   * Process:
     * Utilizes a `for` loop to iterate through each character in the input text.
     * Uses `char.isalpha()` to check if the character is a letter.
     * If it's a letter, obtains the ASCII value of the character using `ord(char)` and calculates the relative position of the character with respect to 'A' or 'a'.
     * Performs the shifting operation `(ascii_val - ord('A' if is_upper else 'a') + shift) % 26` to shift the letter. The `% 26` ensures cycling within the alphabet.
     * Converts the result back to a character using `chr(shifted_ascii + ord('A' if is_upper else 'a'))`.
     * If the character is not a letter, it is directly added to the result.
     * Returns the final encrypted text.
2. `caesar_decrypt` function:
   * Parameters: `text` is the text to be decrypted, and `shift` is the offset used during decryption.
   * Returns: Returns the decrypted text.
   * Process:
     * Decryption is essentially the inverse of encryption, so it directly calls the `caesar_encrypt` function with the negative value of the offset.
     * Returns the final decrypted text.
3. Example usage:
   * Defines the plaintext as "Hello, World!" with a shift of 3.
   * Calls `caesar_encrypt` for encryption, obtaining the ciphertext.
   * Prints the encrypted result.
   * Calls `caesar_decrypt` for decryption, obtaining the decrypted text.
   * Prints the decrypted result.

This code achieves encryption and decryption processes for the Caesar cipher by utilizing ASCII codes for character conversion and shifting operations. It's important to note that the Caesar cipher is a relatively simple substitution cipher and is no longer used in modern cryptography to protect sensitive information due to its susceptibility to various attacks.

Continuing, let's now examine a brute-force attack against this cipher.

```
def caesar_encrypt(plaintext, shift):
    ciphertext = ""
    for char in plaintext:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.isupper():
                ciphertext += chr((ord(char) + shift - 65) % 26 + 65)
            else:
                ciphertext += chr((ord(char) + shift - 97) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            ciphertext += char
    return ciphertext

def caesar_brute_force(ciphertext):
    print("Ciphertext:", ciphertext)
    print("\nBrute Force Decryption:")
    for shift in range(1, 26):
        decrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)
        print(f"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}")

def caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):
    plaintext = ""
    for char in ciphertext:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.isupper():
                plaintext += chr((ord(char) - shift - 65) % 26 + 65)
            else:
                plaintext += chr((ord(char) - shift - 97) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            plaintext += char
    return plaintext

# example
plaintext = "HELLOWORLD"
shift = 3
ciphertext = caesar_encrypt(plaintext, shift)
caesar_brute_force(ciphertext)
```

\
This code implements encryption, decryption, and a brute-force attack against the Caesar cipher.

1. `caesar_encrypt` function:
   * Parameters: `plaintext` is the input string, and `shift` is the offset used during encryption.
   * Returns: Returns the encrypted ciphertext string.
   * Process: For each character in the input, it first checks if it's a letter (`char.isalpha()`). If it is a letter, it encrypts it based on whether it's an uppercase or lowercase letter.
     * For uppercase letters, it calculates the new ASCII value of the character using `ord(char) + shift - 65`, ensures the result is within the range of 26 using modulo operation, and adds 65 to get the new ASCII value of the uppercase letter.
     * For lowercase letters, it performs a similar calculation using `ord(char) + shift - 97`, ensures the result is within the range of 26, and adds 97 to get the new ASCII value of the lowercase letter.
     * If it's not a letter, the character is directly added to the ciphertext.
   * Returns the final encrypted ciphertext.
2. `caesar_brute_force` function:
   * Parameters: `ciphertext` is the encrypted ciphertext string.
   * Process: Uses brute force to decrypt with all possible shift values, calls the `caesar_decrypt` function, and outputs the decryption results for each offset. This function is designed to demonstrate the results of a brute-force attack.
3. `caesar_decrypt` function:
   * Parameters: `ciphertext` is the ciphertext string, and `shift` is the offset used during decryption.
   * Returns: Returns the decrypted plaintext string.
   * Process: Similar to the encryption process, for each character, it checks if it's a letter. If it is a letter, it decrypts based on whether it's an uppercase or lowercase letter.
     * For uppercase letters, it calculates the new ASCII value of the character using `ord(char) - shift - 65`, ensures the result is within the range of 26 using modulo operation, and adds 65 to get the new ASCII value of the uppercase letter.
     * For lowercase letters, it performs a similar calculation using `ord(char) - shift - 97`, ensures the result is within the range of 26, and adds 97 to get the new ASCII value of the lowercase letter.
     * If it's not a letter, the character is directly added to the plaintext.
   * Returns the final decrypted plaintext.
4. Example:
   * Defines the plaintext as "HELLOWORLD" with a shift of 3.
   * Uses the `caesar_encrypt` function for encryption, obtaining the ciphertext.
   * Uses the `caesar_brute_force` function to perform a brute-force attack on the ciphertext, outputting all possible decryption results.

This code is primarily for demonstrating the basic principles of the Caesar cipher and the process of brute-force attacks. In practical applications, the Caesar cipher is insecure, and modern cryptography employs more complex and secure encryption algorithms.

## Monoalphabetic cipher

We now know the shortcomings of the Caesar cipher, so let's learn about the Monoalphabetic Cipher.

The Monoalphabetic Cipher is a basic encryption technique and belongs to the category of substitution ciphers. In a Monoalphabetic Cipher, each plaintext character (typically a letter) is substituted with a fixed ciphertext character. This substitution is one-to-one, meaning each plaintext character corresponds to a unique ciphertext character. Such substitutions are usually based on a key, and the key determines the specific arrangement of the substitution table.

Here are the main features and principles of the Monoalphabetic Cipher:

1. Substitution Table: The substitution table is a mapping of plaintext characters to ciphertext characters. For example, if the table replaces the letter A in plaintext with the letter D in ciphertext, then in the encryption process, all occurrences of A will be replaced with D. The key determines the arrangement of the substitution table.
2. Key: The key is crucial for the Monoalphabetic Cipher. It determines the ordering of letters in the substitution table. Using different keys can generate different substitution tables, resulting in different substitution rules.
3. Encryption Process: The encryption process involves replacing each character in the plaintext with the corresponding ciphertext character based on the substitution table. It is a straightforward, one-to-one substitution operation.
4. Decryption Process: The decryption process is the inverse of encryption, replacing each character in the ciphertext with the corresponding plaintext character based on the substitution table. Decryption requires using the same key to generate the same substitution table.
5. Security: The security of the Monoalphabetic Cipher is relatively low, especially susceptible to frequency analysis attacks. Since each character is substituted one-to-one, frequency analysis can guess possible substitution rules by analyzing the frequency of characters in the ciphertext.

The reasons for the improved security of the Monoalphabetic Cipher compared to the Caesar cipher are primarily:

1. Larger Key Space: The Monoalphabetic Cipher introduces a larger key space because the arrangement of the substitution table can be arbitrary. The Caesar cipher has only 26 fixed shift values, while the key space for the Monoalphabetic Cipher is 26! (26 factorial), which is a significantly large number. This makes exhaustive attacks practically infeasible.
2. Irregular Substitution Rules: The Monoalphabetic Cipher can employ irregular substitution rules, not just simple letter shifts. This increases the difficulty for attackers to perform frequency analysis or other statistical analyses. If the substitution rules are not obviously linear or predictable, cracking becomes more challenging.

Let's now explore the implementation of the Monoalphabetic Cipher.

```
import random

def generate_substitution_key():
    # Generate a random letter substitution table
    alphabet = list('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
    shuffled_alphabet = random.sample(alphabet, len(alphabet))
    substitution_key = dict(zip(alphabet, shuffled_alphabet))
    return substitution_key

def substitution_encrypt(text, substitution_key):
    # Encryption
    encrypted_text = ''.join(substitution_key.get(char, char) for char in text.upper())
    return encrypted_text

def substitution_decrypt(encrypted_text, substitution_key):
    # Decryption
    decryption_key = {v: k for k, v in substitution_key.items()}
    decrypted_text = ''.join(decryption_key.get(char, char) for char in encrypted_text.upper())
    return decrypted_text

# Example usage
plaintext = "Hello, World!"
substitution_key = generate_substitution_key()

# Encryption
encrypted_text = substitution_encrypt(plaintext, substitution_key)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_text}")

# Decryption
decrypted_text = substitution_decrypt(encrypted_text, substitution_key)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_text}")

```

This code segment implements encryption and decryption operations for a simple substitution cipher, using a randomly generated substitution key.

1. `generate_substitution_key` function:
   * This function generates a random letter substitution table (`substitution_key`).
   * It uses the `random.sample` function to randomly select non-repeating letters from the alphabet, creating a shuffled alphabet.
   * It pairs the original alphabet with the shuffled alphabet to construct the letter substitution table (`substitution_key`).
   * Returns the generated letter substitution table.
2. `substitution_encrypt` function:
   * Parameters: `text` is the text to be encrypted, and `substitution_key` is the letter substitution table.
   * Returns: Returns the encrypted text.
   * Process: It replaces each character in the input text. If a character is not in the substitution table, it remains unchanged. The text is converted to uppercase to ensure case-insensitivity.
   * Returns the final encrypted text.
3. `substitution_decrypt` function:
   * Parameters: `encrypted_text` is the text to be decrypted, and `substitution_key` is the letter substitution table.
   * Returns: Returns the decrypted text.
   * Process: Opposite to encryption, it creates a decryption letter substitution table (`decryption_key`) and reversely replaces each character in the encrypted text.
   * Returns the final decrypted text.
4. Example usage:
   * Define plaintext as "Hello, World!".
   * Call `generate_substitution_key` to generate a random letter substitution table.
   * Use `substitution_encrypt` for encryption, obtaining the ciphertext.
   * Print the encrypted result.
   * Use `substitution_decrypt` for decryption, obtaining the decrypted text.
   * Print the decrypted result.
